        <p>Chicken adobo is a filipino recipe. It is a delicious savory dish. I don't think the potatoes, onions or garlic is traditional but I think they taste delicious cooked in the gravy.</p>
        <p>This recipe is fast and easy to make in the Instant Pot, so it's a great weeknight meal!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Bone-in Chicken Thighs or Legs</li>
            <li>1 Large Russet potato</li>
            <li>1 Large white onion</li>
            <li>4 Cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup White Vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>        
        <ol>
            <li>Set Instant Pot to Saute mode and brown chicken to crisp up skin</li>
            <li>While chicken is browning, cut potato into ~1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>Cut onion into quarters</li>
            <li>Lightly smash garlic cloves - just enough to break them open</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, vinegar, and water</li>
            <li>Once chicken skin is crisp, be sure to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom of the Instant Pot so they don't burn during pressure cook</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the ingredients - potatoes, onions, garlic, bay leaf and soy sauce/vinegar mixture</li>
            <li>Set to Pressure Cook, More for 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Once the pressure cook is complete, manually release the pressure</li>
            <li>*OPTIONAL* Open the lid and set to Saute high to reduce the liquid to create a thicker gravy</li>
            <li>Serve with or over white rice</li>
        </ol>
