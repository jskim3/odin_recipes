        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        8 servings
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium head of green or savoy cabbage (about 3½ lb. total), cut through core into 8 wedges</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
            <li>1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots, quartered through root end</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. thyme leaves, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 oz. Gruyère, grated (about 1½ cups)</li>
            <li>½ oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Place oven racks in upper third and middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Place cabbage on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with oil; season lightly with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and edges are golden, 40–45 minutes. (This is an essential first step: It draws out the excess moisture, ensuring that the cream mixture doesn’t get watery.)
                </li>
                
                <li>Meanwhile, bring shallots, garlic, cream, 1 Tbsp. thyme, 1½ tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. pepper to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots and garlic are very soft, 15–20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Transfer to a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
                
                <li>Rub the inside of a 3-qt. shallow baking dish with butter. Arrange cabbage in dish so wedges are lying on a cut side; pour cream mixture over. Bake on middle rack, uncovered, until cream thickens, 30–40 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Heat broiler. Sprinkle Gruyère and Parmesan evenly over cabbage. Broil until cheese is bubbling and gratin is deeply browned, about 4 minutes. Top with more thyme.</li>
                
                <li>Do Ahead: Gratin (without cheese) can be baked 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before sprinkling with cheese and broiling.</li>
        </ol>
